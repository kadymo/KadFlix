## üìñ About the project
KadFlix is a web application that aggregates information about movies and their artists. The goal of KadFlix is to help users choose movies to watch by allowing them to add titles to their favorites list and displaying, among other information, user ratings and streaming services where they can watch.

## üì± Functionalities
‚úÖ I can view different movie collections by genre on the homepage. <br>
‚úÖ I can search for a specific movie using the search field. <br>
‚úÖ I can add a movie to my favorites list, which is saved in the browser's local storage (localStorage). <br>
‚úÖ By selecting a movie, I'm directed to its dedicated page, which displays information such as ratings, where to watch, synopsis, genres, release date, runtime, and cast members. <br>
‚úÖ On the movie page, I have a "Watch trailer" button that directs me to the movie's trailer video on YouTube. <br>
‚úÖ By selecting an actor on the movie page, I can view more information about them, including biography, birth date, birthplace, and the movies they've appeared in. <br>
